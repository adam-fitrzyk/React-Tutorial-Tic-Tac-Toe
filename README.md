This is a practise project to learn the fundamentals of React for JavaScript web applications

This application is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in which:
    - You may claim squares by clicking on them
    - You may return to any previous moves made by clicking on the history tab on the right
    - The status (whose turn, who won, draw) is displayed above the board
    - The winning squares are highlighted yellow once a player wins

To run this simply type "npm start" in the terminal (at root directory) and open your browser to the specified URL
